  <p>Effective date: January 8, 2019</p>
  <p>This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of
    personal data and user analytics when you use this website
    and the choices you have associated with that data. The Digital Humanities Innovation
    Lab at Simon Fraser University operates the website at <a href="https://dhil.lib.sfu.ca/gpi">https://dhil.lib.sfu.ca/gpi</a>.
    The website has no other addresses.</p>
  <p>We collect different types of information for various purposes to provide and improve the
    website. The data collected by the website will be stored on computers located at Simon
    Fraser University, in Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada. If you are located outside
    Canada and choose to provide information to us, please note that we transfer the data to
    Canada and process it there.</p>
  <p>While using the website, we may ask you to provide us with certain personally
    identifiable information that can be used to contact or identify you ("Personal Data").
    This information will only be collected by request. You are not required to provide this
    information to use the website. Personally identifiable information may include, but is
    not limited to email address and first name and last name.</p>

      <h2>User Analytics</h2>
      <p>This website uses Piwik to collect anonymous usage statistics. The usage information is
        limited to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The date and time of your visit to the website</li>
        <li>A record of the pages in the website that you visited</li>
        <li>The time spent on those pages</li>
        <li>An anonymized version of your computer’s Internet address</li>
        <li>The web browser type and version</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You may choose not to have this information tracked, either by configuring your web
        browser to include a <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/06/how-turn-do-not-track-your-browser">“Do not track”</a>
        request with each page view or by opting-out at the
        bottom of this page.</p>
    </div>
  <div>
    
  <h2>Content</h2>
  <p>This website does not allow anyone other than designated administrators to publish content,
    such as comments or uploaded images. We may accept comments on individual pages, but
    those comments will not be made public until an administrator approves and publishes
    each one.</p>
  <p>This website does not hotlink images, videos, or other content from other sites.</p>
  <p>This website does not use fonts or icons from third-party servers which could be used to
    track users.</p>
  </div>
    <div>
  <h2>Additional Software</h2>
  <p>This website does not load software in your web browser that serves any purpose
    beyond displaying the website and its assets—meaning it does not use your user agent to
    mine cryptocurrency, for example.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
  <h2>Encryption</h2>
  <p>This website uses encryption provided by Let’s Encrypt, and all requests not using
    encryption are redirected to the equivalent encrypted page. This encryption prevents
    anyone between your web browser and the web server (such as your Internet service
    provider) from seeing details about what was requested or what the resulting page
    contains.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
